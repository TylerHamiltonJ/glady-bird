# Glady Bird

Glady Bird is a political satire game created by Tyler Hamilion, forked from a Flappy Bird clone created by Code Explained.

Glady Bird was created during Sydney's COVID-19 lockdown in 2021, during the issues with vaccine logistics.

## To Run

`yarn install` to install webpack. Webpack is not required to run the project, but helps when deploying to slightly reduce hosting costs.

Glady Bird should run without any other requirements. Open the `index.html` file in your browser of choice, and have fun!

## Thanks to

Special thanks to [Code Explained's Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArCFchlTq4&t=307s) for the instructions, and the base of the code.
